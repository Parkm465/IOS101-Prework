## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
**Favorite 3-5 applications and 2-3 features that make them my favorite app.**
1. **Youtube**
   1. Bottom Button Panel Navigation makes it easy to switch tabs
   2. Having the option to display the video at the bottom makes searching for other videos more easier
2. **Fidelity**
   1. The green or red numbers underneath the total value or stock ticket shows how the item has changed in price.
   2. The line graph shows how much money you've gained over time
   3. Main button at Bottom Button Panel makes it easy to commit actions related to your investments
3. **Fitness**
   1. Has red loop that fills up as you walk around
   2. Bar graphs of the averages amount of steps you take during certain days
   3. Badges that you earn once you've completed a certain amount of steps.
4. **Outlook**
   1. Side bar navigation
   2. Collection of accounts to recieve emails from
5. **Shazam**
   1. It's main feature is a button at the middle of the screen that allows users to recieve information about the song that they're listening to
   2. You swipe up to look at the past songs that you've made the app listen to and these songs are found on the apps that you connect to it

**Here are some ideas that I'd like to build:**

Idea 1:
 
 Consider how the chrome app on the iPhone doesn't allow for any extension. One idea for an app is to have a search engine that allows for ad blockers & other extensions. 
 
 Idea 2:
  
  In addition to the previous idea, I think that makes filling out job applications easier on the phone like Simplify but as an app would be really nice. The idea is that the app would work like other job posting apps; however, it will actually go onto the company's websites, make creating new accounts easier (saving the account username & password or using the same ones for each website) and filling out most of the information using the resume the user has uploaded. It's record information like skills & what the company will be looking for in order to help users prepare for interviews. If we wanted to extend this idea even further, we can have an email management tab that specifically keeps track of dates and statuses of the application as sent by the company's email.

  Idea 3:
  
  App that makes controlling BlueTooth connections easier. For example, when my mac connects to my bluetooth earbuds, they don't disconnnect when I close my mac. This can be frusturating, because I would have to turn off my earbuds, turn them back on, and then make sure that I connect them to my phone quickly or else I'll have to repeat the process again. Having an app that can disconnect the bluetooth connection of my macbook would remove one of the minor irritations in my life.

  Idea 4:
  
  An app called Jump Rope which is basically like the Fitness app but it tracks the count of your specific exercises like bench presses and checks if you reached the same amount that you completed in your previous workout or if your surpassed it. Basically, it gamifies working out at the gym.
